	<p>When designing the balcony garden of your dreams, there are plenty of ways to maximize verdant greenery, colorful florals, and fragrant herbs. Your options include creating lush living walls, installing vertical or railing planters, planting container gardens, and even working with a trellis or two. Youâ€™ll save money starting your garden from scratch rather than purchasing full-grown plants, which will be worth the wait (promise!)</p>
